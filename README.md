### Usage

`with <program>`


Starts an interactive shell with where every command is prefixed using `<program>`.

For example:
```
$ with git
git> add .
git> commit -a -m "Commited"
git> push
```


Can also be used for compound commands.
```
$ with java Primes
java Primes> 1
2
java Primes> 4
7
```

And to repeat commands:
```
$ with gcc -o output input.c
gcc -o -output input.c>
<enter>
Compiling...
gcc -o -output input.c>
```


To execute a shell command proper prefix line with `:`.


`git> :ls`

You can also drop and add different commands.

```
git> +add
git add> <some file>
git add> -
git>
```

To exit use either `:q` or `:exit`.

Currently supports command history and limited completions.
